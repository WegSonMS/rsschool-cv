Hi! My name is Misha, and I love learning. I like to learn something new, and a year ago I discovered js for myself. All this year I have been looking for information about programming, but without a teacher it was very difficult. And maybe three days ago I found a very interesting source, it was "rs school". I immediately realized that this was a good chance for me to find friends and teachers who understand my hobbies.I wish my hobby to remain very important to me.Hi!
